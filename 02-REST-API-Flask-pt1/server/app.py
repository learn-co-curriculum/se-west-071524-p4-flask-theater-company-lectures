# Serialization
# Postman

# Set Up:
# In Terminal, `cd` into `server` and run the following:
# export FLASK_APP=app.py
# export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
# flask db init
# flask db revision --autogenerate -m 'Create tables'
# flask db upgrade
# python seed.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, make_response, request
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_restful import Api, Resource
from models import CastMember, Production, db

# 1. ‚úÖ Import `Api` and `Resource` from `flask_restful`
# ‚ùì What do these two classes do at a higher level?


app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///app.db"
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = False
# Note: `app.json.compact = False` configures JSON responses to print on indented lines
app.json.compact = False

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

# 2. ‚úÖ Initialize the Api
# `api = Api(app)`
api = Api(app)

# 3. ‚úÖ Create a Production class that inherits from Resource


class Productions(Resource):

    # 4. ‚úÖ Create a GET (All) Route
    # 4.1 Make a `get` method that takes `self` as a param.
    def get(self):
        # 4.2 Create a `productions` list.
        productions = Production.query.all()
        # 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For each `production`, create a dictionary
        # containing all attributes before appending to the `productions` list.
        # prods_list = [
        #     {
        #         "title": production.title,
        #         "genre": production.genre,
        #         "budget": production.budget,
        #         "image": production.image,
        #         "director": production.director,
        #         "ongoing": production.ongoing,
        #     }
        #     for production in productions
        # ]
        # 10. ‚úÖ Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
        # 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with `to_dict` before setting them to a list.
        prods_list = [
            production.to_dict(only=("title", "director")) for production in productions
        ]
        # 4.4 Create a `response` variable and set it to:
        #  #make_response(
        #       jsonify(productions),
        #       200
        #  )
        # 10.2 Invoke `make_response`, pass it the production list along with a status of 200. Set `make_response` to a
        # `response` variable.
        # 10.3 Return the `response` variable.
        # 10.4 After building the route, run the server and test your results in the browser.
        response = make_response(
            prods_list, 200
        )  # make_response uses jsonify to serialize dictionaries
        # 4.5 Return `response`.
        return response
        # 4.6 After building the route, run the server and test in the browser.

        # 5. ‚úÖ Serialization
        # This is great, but there's a cleaner way to do this! Serialization will allow us to easily add our
        # associations as well.
        # Navigate to `models.py` for Steps 6 - 9.

    # 11. ‚úÖ Create a POST Route
    # Prepare a POST request in Postman. Under the `Body` tab, select `form-data` and fill out the body
    # of a production request.

    # Create the POST route
    # üìö Review With Students: request object

    # 11.1 Create a `post` method and pass it `self`.
    def post(self):
        request_json = request.get_json()
        # 11.2 Create a new production from the `request.json` object.
        new_production = Production(
            title=request_json["title"],
            genre=request_json["genre"],
            budget=request_json["budget"],
            image=request_json["image"],
            director=request_json["director"],
            description=request_json["description"],
            ongoing=request_json["ongoing"],
        )
        # 11.3 Add and commit the new production.
        db.session.add(new_production)
        db.session.commit()

        # 11.4 Convert the new production to a dictionary with `to_dict`
        # 11.5 Set `make_response` to a `response` variable and pass it the new production along with a status of 201.
        return make_response(new_production.to_dict(), 201)

        # 11.6 Test the route in Postman.

# 12. ‚úÖ Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`
